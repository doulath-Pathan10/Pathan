Sure! Below are sample test cases using Jest along with React Testing Library (RTL) for the `postalCodeValidation` function you provided. Given that the function involves an external API call using axios, we'll mock axios to avoid making actual network requests during the tests.

### Test Cases Setup

First, make sure to install the necessary packages if you haven't done so already:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom axios
```

### Test Cases

Create a file named `postalCodeValidation.test.js` or similar in your `__tests__` directory, and include the following code:

```javascript
import axios, { AxiosError } from 'axios';
import { postalCodeValidation } from './path-to-your-function';

// Mocking Axios
jest.mock('axios');
const mockedAxios = axios as jest.Mocked<typeof axios>;

describe('postalCodeValidation', () => {
  const channelrefNumber = 12345;
  const applicants = {};

  afterEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  test('should return applicants data when API call is successful', async () => {
    const mockResponse = {
      data: {
        applicants: {
          block_rwb_a_1: 'Block A',
          building_name_rwb_a_1: 'Building 123',
          street_name_rwb_a_1: 'Main Street'
        }
      }
    };

    mockedAxios.get.mockResolvedValueOnce(mockResponse);

    const result = await postalCodeValidation('123456', channelrefNumber, applicants)();

    expect(result).toEqual({
      block_rwb_a_1: 'Block A',
      building_name_rwb_a_1: 'Building 123',
      street_name_rwb_a_1: 'Main Street'
    });

    expect(mockedAxios.get).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      expect.stringContaining('zipCode=123456')
    );
  });

  test('should return error when API call fails', async () => {
    const mockError: AxiosError = {
      isAxiosError: true,
      message: 'Network Error',
      name: 'AxiosError',
      config: {},
      code: 'ERR_NETWORK',
      response: undefined,
      toJSON: jest.fn(),
    } as any;

    mockedAxios.get.mockRejectedValueOnce(mockError);

    const result = await postalCodeValidation('123456', channelrefNumber, applicants)();

    expect(result).toEqual(mockError);
  });
});
```

### Explanation of the Test Cases

1. **Mocking Axios**: We mock axios using `jest.mock('axios')` which allows us to simulate API responses without making real requests. We then create a strongly typed version of the mock for better type safety.

2. **Success Case**:
   - We simulate a successful API response using `mockResolvedValueOnce`.
   - We invoke the `postalCodeValidation` function and check if it returns the expected applicant data.
   - We also validate that the correct URL was called including the query parameter.

3. **Error Case**:
   - We simulate an error response using `mockRejectedValueOnce`.
   - We call the function and check that it returns the error object as expected.

### Running the Tests

You can run your tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

Make sure you have Jest configured properly in your project. If it's not pre-configured, you'll need to add a Jest configuration in your `package.json` or as a separate `jest.config.js` file.

These tests will help ensure that your `postalCodeValidation` function behaves as expected for both success and error scenarios. Happy testing!
